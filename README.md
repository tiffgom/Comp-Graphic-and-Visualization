## Designing Software ##
  
 *   Working with and learning Open GL has helped me craft the skill of learning to prototype. This is the first project I have worked on where the visual representation of the program is one of the main components. I found myself, on a weekly basis before each assignment or milestone, sketching the objects in accordance with the requirements to render. Whether it would be a prime shape, a camera, or a light source, I relied heavily on graphing the objects on paper. As I worked on my scene specifically, this eased the process of layering my scene and introducing new objects as I progressed.

*    To begin I would practice prototyping the object I planned to render on paper reflective of the requirements provided. This involved making design decisions on whether I could simplify an object, the lighting the object would need, what shapes I need to draw to build it, and researching textures to make the object as real as possible. After establishing where I would position it in terms of x,y, and z, I would use online tools to map out the coordinates for the object's heights, width, stacks, etc... Then I would decide how to structure the object before beginning the process of coding.

*    In previous courses, I have learned the importance of the design process before beginning to actually build a program, but this is the first project where I have first hand experience in building a program that is reliant on that process of design. This process has been instrumental in helping me not only stay organized but helped me break the project up into smaller components to complete. By setting goals structured around the requirements and timetable, I was able to stay on track. As I progress and begin working on larger and more complex projects (this felt large and complex), I believe the tactics I employed in my design approach will ensure I am efficient in any future work.

    

## Developing Programs ## 
  
 *   Modularization was a major development strategy I employed while working on my 3D scene. With over a thousand lines of code in my main source code, I could have modularized even more so. This was a project where I tested often and failed just as often, so it was really important I compartmentalized my code so as to not break my program. The way the course is structured really helped me sharpen this skill. Instead of rendering a new object in my scene every week, I focused on a single object and developed the skills and understanding that go into bringing that object to life, such as a camera in relation to the object, color, texture, positioning, drawing of shapes, and user input (using different tools). 
  
*    Iteration was a key factor that enabled me to not only present a readable and maintainable program but helped me deliver my project within the deadline. There is a lot of repetition involved in positioning, lighting, texturing, and drawing the shapes. For example, with the exception of the sphere, every shape present in my project is used more than once. Most of my primitive shapes are developed through iterations of the coordinates that make up a triangle.
  
*    At the beginning of the project, my focus was strictly on being able to render and physically see an object that at minimum looked similar to that of my image. Through each milestone, I began to focus more on how to structure my objects (for example I created structures to store my cube and plane data), how to organize functions, and basically how to develop my program in a way so that as I introduced new elements weekly, I could go back and adjust an object's positioning, color, or texture without altering large parts of my code.
