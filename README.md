#### 1. How do I approach designing software? ####
  * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
  
    Working with and learning Open GL has helped me craft the skill of learning to prototype. This is the first project I have worked on where       the visual representation of the program is one of the main components. I found myself, on a weekly basis before each assignment or             milestone, sketching the objects in accordance to the requirements that to render. Whether it would be a prime shape, a camera, or a light       source, I relied heavily on graphing the objects on paper. As I worked on my scene specifically, this eased the process of layer my scene       and introducing new objects as I progressed.
  * What design process did you follow for your project work?

    To begin I would practice protoyping the object I planned to rendered on paper reflective of the requirments provided. This involved making     design decisions of whether I could simplify an object, the lighting the object would need, what shapes I need to draw to build it, and         research textures to make the object as real as possible.After establishing where I would position it in terms of an x,y,z, I would use         online tools to map out the coordinates for the objects heights, width, stacks, etc... Then I would decide how to structure the object           before begining the process of coding.
  * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

    In previous courses I have learnt the importance of the design process before beginning to actually build a program, but this is the first     project where I have built a program that is reliant on that process of design. This proccess has been instrumental in helping not only      stay organized, but helped me break the project up into smaller components to complete. By setting goals structured around the requirements    and time table, I was able to stay on track. As I progress and begin working on larger and more complex projects (this felt large and          complex), I believe the tactics I employed in my design approach will ensure I am effecient in any future work.

    

#### 2. How do I approach developing programs? #### 
  * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  * How did iteration factor into your development?
  * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

#### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? ####
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
